Digital minimalism is about being intentional with your technology use. It's not about using less technology - it's about using it better.

## Principles

1. **Intentionality**: Every app and service should serve a clear purpose
2. **Quality over quantity**: Focus on tools that add real value
3. **Mindful consumption**: Be deliberate about what you consume online

## Practical Steps

- Uninstall apps you don't use
- Turn off unnecessary notifications
- Create technology-free times and spaces
- Choose simple, focused tools

The goal isn't to become a luddite. It's to use technology in ways that align with your values and goals.
