In an age of algorithmic feeds and platform lock-in, there's something deeply satisfying about having your own corner of the internet.

## Why Build Your Own Site?

Building a personal website is an act of digital autonomy. It's about reclaiming ownership of your online presence and expressing yourself on your own terms.

## The Philosophy of Minimalism

Minimalism in web design isn't about removing everything until nothing remains. It's about removing everything that doesn't serve a purpose, until only the essential remains.

## Getting Started

If you're thinking about building your own site, start simple. Create a single HTML file with a brief introduction. Add some basic styling. Put it online. Then iterate.

This website is always going to be work in progress for me.
